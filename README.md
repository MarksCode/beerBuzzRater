# beerBuzzRater

A script I wrote with node.js that takes the html of beeradvocate's top 250 beers list and parses and sorts it's data to create a table ranked on the alcohol percentage of it's listed beers.

After running this script, go to http://localhost:8080/ in your browser to generate the table.
